# SHOOT-Android-Showcase-
Portfolio Showcase: 'SHOOT!'

> This is a portfolio showcase for "SHOOT!", a game I helped produce as part of a two-person collaboration, under the name 'Cautious Games'. 

*((In collaboration with [Citurinn](https://github.com/citurinn)))*

## About The Game 
In a never-ending meteor storm, destroy any obstacles on your way, and fight with 4 different bosses throughout your adventure! Beware, the game gets harder as you progress!
